# About

Alpine linux is a non-commercial general purpose Linux distribution
designed for power users who appreciate resource effiency, simplicity
and security.

## Small

Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller
and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux. A container with
a fully usable base system takes no more than 7-10 MB. This makes it ideal
for containers and diskless systems.

Less disk usage also means less disk IO and fewer cache misses which makes
the system feel snappy.

## Simple

Alpine Linux tries to be simple and stay out of the way for the user. It
uses the OpenRC init system (similar to gentoo) and provides a very simple
but fully usable default while still giving the option to chose more advanced
tools.

## Secure

Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. It has proactive security
features, such as a Grsecurity patched kernel and all userland compiled with
position independent executables (PIE) and stack smashing protection, that
prevent security holes from being exploited.
