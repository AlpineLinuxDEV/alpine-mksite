# About


Alpine Linux is a community-developed operating system designed for x86 Routers, Firewalls, VPNs, VoIP and servers.

Alpine Linux is and always will be free of charge. You do not pay any licensing fees. You can download, use and share Alpine Linux with anyone for absolutely nothing.

Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. It has proactive security features, such as PaX and SSP, that prevent security holes from being exploited.

Alpine Linux uses the uClibc C library and all of the base tools from BusyBox. These are normally found on embedded systems and are smaller than the tools found on GNU/Linux systems.


## Why Should I Try It?

### It is easy to install

You can boot it from a USB stick and have a fully configured system in less than 10 minutes.


### It is simple

The package management and init system is a breeze to use.


### It is more secure

When The Linux 0-day vmsplice vulnerability was causing admins everywhere to upgrade their kernels post-haste, Alpine Linux systems were basically impervious. Yes, the code crashed the application, but the PaX protection prevented system compromise. The value of PaX and SSP has been proven on more than one occasion.


### It is small

The traditional GNU/Linux base system is over 100MB in size (excluding the kernel), while the base system in Alpine Linux is only 4-5MB in size (excluding the kernel).


### It is great for experimenting

Since the system configuration can be backed up to a single file, you will be able to test configurations before deploying them to production systems. (See Alpine Local Backup.)


### It supports Linux Containers

Similar to FreeBSD Jails, it allows you to run your applications in their own lightweight virtual environment.
